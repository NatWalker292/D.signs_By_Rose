            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>Designing with bright colors and simple shapes is my favorite segway for connection to others. I strive to invoke feelings of joy and
                comfort with my designs that will leave a lasting impact. I am largely inspired by graphic design incorporated into movies and shows.
                Artists such as Annie Atkins are a great example of this. All the graphics in The Grand Budapest Hotel are her work. My Touch of Grace
                business cards are inspired by her clean designs. A love for reading causes me to pull inspiration from book covers illustrated by
                artists such as Louise Fili. They use a unique style of script-like text. Inspiration from these illustrations can be seen in the
                hand-lettering I include in some of my watercolor paintings. I believe that art and design are inspiring and I want people to walk
                away from my designs with a more positive outlook.
